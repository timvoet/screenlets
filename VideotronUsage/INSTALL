#You need to rename The Repository to VideotronUsage for the screenlet-packager to work.  
#

to build from source
1) checkout the project
git clone git://github.com/timvoet/videotronusage.git VideotronUsage

the folder must be in that case ( screenlet-packager is case sensitive )

from the directory you cloned the project into, execute the following command
screenlet-package VideotronUsage

you will now have a tar.gz file that you can install using the screenlet manager UI
